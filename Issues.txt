1. create_simple block: can block size exactly the container size?
    for example can 4 blocks with [l,w,h] = 50,50,50 filled in a container size [100,50,100]?
    currently our code is not allowed unless the container size is [101,51,101]
2. create_general_blocks didnt add volume to the datatype, set_volume accepts LWH but general block can only gives total
volume, change datatype or calculate the LWH  --- resolved volume issues in branch ytang
3. need to track the availability of blocks -
4. changed Block variable id to a list of id for both simple block and general blocks, same with quantity
5. create_general_blocks have same boxes arrange plan, need to remove redundancy --maybe?
6. should we use spacelist as stack all the time?
7, done
8. Block id doesnt have 0
9. containerSize and items available make them to global variable , currently I save item_available into state
10. went through tree_search.py
11. some place in buildm-1 tree about pop and back ..


Meeting memos:
1. Block.py: change blocks representation a list of blocks ie. Block A = [Block B, Block C] , and each block will have is own id and quantity dictionary.
2.
