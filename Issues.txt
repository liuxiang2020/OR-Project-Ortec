1. create_simple block: can block size exactly the container size?
    for example can 4 blocks with [l,w,h] = 50,50,50 filled in a container size [100,50,100]?
    currently our code is not allowed unless the container size is [101,51,101]
2. create_general_blocks didnt add volume to the datatype, set_volume accepts LWH but general block can only gives total
volume, change datatype or calculate the LWH  --- resolved volume issues in branch ytang
3. need to track the availability of blocks
4. changed Block variable id to a list of id for both simple block and general blocks, same with quantity
5. create_general_blocks have a lot same boxes arrange plan, need to remove redundancy
6. create_residual_space, inside the function we can try update the state.occupiedspace, also spaceStack type need to specify,
is a list or a stack? both pop and append were used for this variable.
7, push space into the spacestack need to follow a order? largest first?
8. Block id doesnt have 0..... remember ....
